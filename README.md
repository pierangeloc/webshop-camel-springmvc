# webshop-camel-springmvc
a project to show how to integrate Camel routes in controllers.
The use case is a simple webshop with a few products and 2 distribution centers.
We want to manage the logic behind the controllers through Camel DSL.
Use hawtio to monitor the routes (http://localhost:8080/hawtio)

TODO: Use cucumber to specify integration tests for whole route
